# To-do: 
- add configs for listener messages 
- add version command which checks if there's a new relevant commit here
- create a proper consolidated commands interface myself instead of piggybacking off some other user's code
- adapt asyncplayerchatlistener to use the new event instead of using the deprecated event
- leverage kyori adventureapi for chat formatting and remove deprecated api calls
